<h3 id="datasets">Datasets</h3>
<h4 id="biorxiv">BioRxiv</h4>
<p>BioRxiv <span class="citation" data-cites="i9BKPuqb">[<a href="#ref-i9BKPuqb" role="doc-biblioref">1</a>]</span> is a repository of biological and biomedical research preprints.
We downloaded an xml snapshot of this repository on February 3, 2020 from bioRxiv’s Amazon S3 resource <span class="citation" data-cites="9gVmEi52">[<a href="#ref-9gVmEi52" role="doc-biblioref">2</a>]</span> that contained the full text and image content of 98,023 preprints.
Preprints on bioRxiv are versioned, and in our snapshot 26,905 of 98,023 contained more than one version.
When preprints had multiple versions, we used only the latest one.
Preprints in this snapshot were grouped into one of twenty-nine different categories.
Each preprint was also classified as a new result, confirmatory finding, or contradictory finding.
Some preprints in this snapshot have been withdrawn from bioRxiv.
When a preprint is withdrawn, its content is replaced with the reason for withdrawal.
Because we used the latest version, withdrawn preprints in our analysis contained only statements indicating their removal.</p>
<h4 id="pubmed-central">PubMed Central</h4>
<p>PubMed Central (PMC) <span class="citation" data-cites="u294RvPz">[<a href="#ref-u294RvPz" role="doc-biblioref">3</a>]</span> is a repository that contains free-to-read articles.
PMC contains two types of contributions: closed access articles from research funded by the United States National Institutes of Health (NIH) appearing after an embargo period and articles published under Gold Open Access <span class="citation" data-cites="iyblQx2M">[<a href="#ref-iyblQx2M" role="doc-biblioref">4</a>]</span> publishing schemes.
Paper availability within PMC is largely dependent on the journal’s participation level <span class="citation" data-cites="lBh7pyRc">[<a href="#ref-lBh7pyRc" role="doc-biblioref">5</a>]</span>.
Individual journals have can fully participate in submitting articles to PMC, selectively participate sending only a few few of papers to PMC, only submit papers according to NIH’s public access policy <span class="citation" data-cites="vGaAJBqg">[<a href="#ref-vGaAJBqg" role="doc-biblioref">6</a>]</span>, or not participate at all.
As of September 2019, PMC had 5,725,819 articles available <span class="citation" data-cites="rzmpIYmn">[<a href="#ref-rzmpIYmn" role="doc-biblioref">7</a>]</span>.
Out of these 5 million articles, about 3 million were open access and available for text processing systems <span class="citation" data-cites="rURwqquJ 18ZyyTcTe">[<a href="#ref-rURwqquJ" role="doc-biblioref">8</a>,<a href="#ref-18ZyyTcTe" role="doc-biblioref">9</a>]</span>.
We downloaded a snapshot of this open access subset on January 31, 2020.
This snapshot contains papers such as literature reviews, book reviews, editorials, case reports, research articles and more; however, we used only the research articles.</p>
<h3 id="comparing-corpora">Comparing Corpora</h3>
<p>We used gensim <span class="citation" data-cites="Gc4hOzur">[<a href="#ref-Gc4hOzur" role="doc-biblioref">10</a>]</span> (version 3.8.1) to preprocess the bioRxiv and PubMed Central corpora.
We removed the 337 gensim-provided stopwords.
Throughout our analysis we encountered non-word symbols (e.g., <span class="math inline">\(\pm\)</span>), so we refer to words and symbols as tokens to avoid confusion.</p>
<p>Following the cleaning process, we calculated the frequency of every token shared between both corpora.
Because many tokens were unique to one set or the other and observed at low frequency, we used the union of the top 100 most frequent tokens from each corpus to compare them.
We generated a contingency table and calculated the odds ratio for each token.
Furthermore, we also calculated the 95% confidence interval for each odds ratio <span class="citation" data-cites="Lgm5q6mO">[<a href="#ref-Lgm5q6mO" role="doc-biblioref">11</a>]</span>.</p>
<h3 id="visualizing-the-preprint-landscape">Visualizing the Preprint Landscape</h3>
<h4 id="generate-document-representation">Generate Document Representation</h4>
<p>We used gensim <span class="citation" data-cites="Gc4hOzur">[<a href="#ref-Gc4hOzur" role="doc-biblioref">10</a>]</span> (version 3.8.1) to train a word2vec continuous bag of words (CBOW) <span class="citation" data-cites="1GhHIDxuW">[<a href="#ref-1GhHIDxuW" role="doc-biblioref">12</a>]</span> model over the bioRxiv corpus.
Our neural network architecture had 300 hidden nodes, and we trained this model for 20 epochs.
We set a fixed random seed and otherwise used gensim’s default settings.
Following training, we generated a document vector for every article within bioRxiv and PubMed Central.
This document vector is calculated by taking the average of every token present within a given article, ignoring those that were absent from the word2vec model.</p>
<h4 id="dimensionality-reduction-of-document-embeddings">Dimensionality Reduction of Document Embeddings</h4>
<p>We used principal component analysis (PCA) <span class="citation" data-cites="qkjVrvqt">[<a href="#ref-qkjVrvqt" role="doc-biblioref">13</a>]</span> to project bioRxiv document vectors into a low dimensional space.
We trained this model using scikit-learn’s <span class="citation" data-cites="QrtjCwXA">[<a href="#ref-QrtjCwXA" role="doc-biblioref">14</a>]</span> implementation of a randomized solver <span class="citation" data-cites="7tMTyalf">[<a href="#ref-7tMTyalf" role="doc-biblioref">15</a>]</span> with a random seed of 100, output of 50 principal components, and default settings for all other parameters.
For each principal component we calculated its cosine similarity with all tokens in our word2vec model’s vocabulary.
We report the top 100 positive and negative scoring tokens in the form of word clouds, where the size of each word corresponds to the magnitude of similarity and color represents positive (blue) or negative (orange) association.</p>
<h3 id="discovering-unannotated-preprint-publication-relationships">Discovering Unannotated Preprint-Publication Relationships</h3>
<p>Automated procedures are in place to link preprints to peer reviewed versions and many journals require authors to update preprints with a link to the published version.
However, automated procedures at <em>bioRxiv</em> are often based on exact matching of certain attributes and authors can forget to establish a link after publication.
For example, authors can change the title between a preprint and published version (e.g., <span class="citation" data-cites="1Bpwk7s3x">[<a href="#ref-1Bpwk7s3x" role="doc-biblioref">16</a>]</span> and <span class="citation" data-cites="iBFkqblV">[<a href="#ref-iBFkqblV" role="doc-biblioref">17</a>]</span>), which prevents <em>bioRxiv</em> from automatically establishing a link.
If the authors do not report the publication to <em>bioRxiv</em>, the preprint and the published version are treated as distinct entities despite representing the same underlying research.
We recognized that the distance in embedding space could reveal preprint to published version links that were missed by existing automated processes.
First, we used CrossRef <span class="citation" data-cites="XnHb341s">[<a href="#ref-XnHb341s" role="doc-biblioref">18</a>]</span> to identify bioRxiv preprints that were linked to a corresponding published article.
We filtered out links that contained papers not in PubMed Central’s Open Access corpus.
Following the preprocessing step, we calculated the distribution of known preprint to published distances by taking the Euclidean distance between the preprint’s embedding coordinates and the coordinates of the published version.
We also calculated a background distribution, which consisted of the distance between each preprint with an annotated publication and a randomly selected article from the same journal the published version.
Next, we calculated distances between preprints without a published version link with PubMed Central articles that weren’t matched with a corresponding preprint.
We filtered any potential links with distances that were greater than the minimum value of the background distribution to reduce the curation burden.
Lastly, we binned the remaining pairs based on percentiles from the annotated pairs at the [0,25th percentile), [25th percentile, 50th percentile), [50th percentile, 75th percentile), and [75th percentile, minimum background distance).
We randomly sampled 50 articles from each bin for manual annotation.
We shuffled these four sets to produce a list of 200 potential preprint-published pairs with a randomized order.
We supplied these candidates to two scientists to manually determine if each link between a preprint and a putative matched version was correct or incorrect.
After the curation process we encountered eight mismatches.
These mismatches were supplied to a third scientist, who carefully reviewed each case and made a final determination.
Lastly, we used this curated set to evaluate the extent to which distance in the embedding space revealed true but unannotated links between preprints and their published verisons.</p>
<h3 id="journal-recommendation">Journal Recommendation</h3>
<p>We aimed to predict the journal a paper would eventually be published in based on its embedding representation.
We illustrate our recommendations as a short list along with a network visualization available at <a href="https://greenelab.github.io/annorxiver-journal-recommender/">https://greenelab.github.io/annorxiver-journal-recommender/</a>.
Since we sought to examine if embeddings were related to publication venue, we used a simple k-nearest neighbors approach with Euclidean distance to recommend journals.</p>
<p>First, we filtered all journals that had fewer than 100 papers in the PMC dataset.
A subset of our PMC corpus was directly linked to papers in bioRxiv as they had been published as open access articles.
We held out this subset and treated it as our gold standard test set.
We used the remainder of the PMC corpus for training and initial evaluation via cross validation.
We considered a list of ten journal suggestions to be an appropriate number and we considered a prediction to be a true positive if the correct journal appeared within the ten closest neighbors of the query article.</p>
<p>Certain journals publish articles in a focused topic area, while others publish articles that cover many topics.
Likewise, some journals have a publication rate of at most hundreds of papers per year while others publish at a rate of at least ten-thousand papers per year.
Accounting for these characteristics, we designed two approaches for recommending journals.</p>
<p>The first approach is based on individual paper proximity, which enabled us to provide an example of the specific article or articles that led to the prediction.
Conversely, predictions using this technique could be biased due to the overrepresentation of general topic journals.
We call this approach the paper-based classifier.
This classifier takes a query article that has been projected onto the embedding space trained on bioRxiv preprints as input and reports the journals of the top ten closest papers.
The number of journals returned via this method could be less than ten as multiple papers in close proximity to query article may belong to the same journal.</p>
<p>The second approach is based on close proximity to a journal’s centroid.
This technique provides recommendations that are more focused on domain-specific publication venues.
We call this approach the journal-based classifier.
This classifier was trained by computing journal centroids via taking the average embedding of all papers published in each journal.
Following the centroid calculation, this classifier takes a query article projected onto the same embedding space as above for input and reports the top ten nearest journals centroids.
Both the paper-based classifier and the journal-based classifier were optimized via 10-fold cross validation.
We evaluated performance of both classifiers on our gold standard test set of published preprints.</p>
<p>We used SAUCIE <span class="citation" data-cites="LxhnWcbN">[<a href="#ref-LxhnWcbN" role="doc-biblioref">19</a>]</span> to train a model that uses the latent space of a neural network to learn an embedding suitable for visualization.
This model enabled us to visualized the PMC corpus and to efficiently embed new papers and preprints with the space.
We trained this model using a learning rate of 0.001, lambda_b of 0, lambda_c of 0.001, and lambda_d of 0.001 for 2000 iterations.
We used the fully trained model to project user-requested <em>bioRxiv</em> preprints onto the generated landscape to enable users to see where their preprint falls along the landscape.</p>

<p>Each preprint on bioRxiv has an author-selected topic area, and the predominant area in past reports has been neuroscience <span class="citation" data-cites="iPnRRJya">[<a href="#ref-iPnRRJya" role="doc-biblioref">20</a>]</span>.
Our analysis of the full text release of bioRxiv confirms this previous finding (Figure <a href="#fig:biorxiv_categories">1</a>).
The author-selected topic area abundances that we found in the full text largely matched previous studies <span class="citation" data-cites="iPnRRJya mTE5h91z">[<a href="#ref-iPnRRJya" role="doc-biblioref">20</a>,<a href="#ref-mTE5h91z" role="doc-biblioref">21</a>]</span>.
One exception was microbiology, which has a larger share of preprints than in a previous report from 2018 <span class="citation" data-cites="iPnRRJya">[<a href="#ref-iPnRRJya" role="doc-biblioref">20</a>]</span> (Figure <a href="#fig:biorxiv_categories">1</a>).
Authors also select from three article types when they upload their preprints.
We found that most preprints are categorized as new results (Figure <a href="#fig:biorxiv_headings">2</a>), which is consistent with previous findings <span class="citation" data-cites="mTE5h91z">[<a href="#ref-mTE5h91z" role="doc-biblioref">21</a>]</span>.</p>

The dotted line provides a breaking point between both categories.
The plot on the right (B) is a bar chart of token frequency appearing in bioRxiv and PMC respectively.</figcaption>

</div>
<p>The linguistic style of the bioRxiv corpus differs from the PMC corpus.
We compared preprints in bioRxiv with published manuscripts in PMC.
We found that tokens such as “neuron”, “genome”, “RNA” and “network” had a high odds ratio, indicating enrichment in bioRxiv (Figure <a href="#fig:biorxiv_pmc_global_comparison">3</a>).
Likewise, we found tokens such as “patient”, “health”, <span class="math inline">\(\pm\)</span>, and “ml” to have a low odds ratio, indicating enrichment in PMC (Figure <a href="#fig:biorxiv_pmc_global_comparison">3</a>).
This separation of tokens suggests a prevalence of articles focused on clinical trials and patient research within PMC compared to bioRxiv.
Furthermore, bioRxiv has a predominance of neuroscience and bioinformatic topics.
In regard to writing, citation styles diversify from the familiar “et al.” form as preprints transition through the publication process.
Additionally, published articles have an increase of typesetting (<span class="math inline">\(\pm\)</span>) and measurement symbols (“ml”, “age”) compared to preprints.</p>

<p>A preprint’s linguistic style can change once a preprint has undergone the revision process prior to being published.
We quantified this linguistic difference by calculating the odds ratio of tokens appearing in the union in bioRxiv preprints and their published counterparts within PMC.
Tokens with an odds ratio greater than one are mainly centered on paper/figure references and research specific terms (Figure <a href="#fig:biorxiv_pmc_pre_published_comp">4</a>).
Tokens with an odds ratio of less than one are focused on data availability, and research measurements such as number of cases and controls or significance testing (Figure <a href="#fig:biorxiv_pmc_pre_published_comp">4</a>).</p>

<p>We explored the primary differences between the full text of bioRxiv preprints by performing principal components analysis on generated document embeddings.
We visualized the correspondence between tokens and the loadings for each principal component (Figure {<a href="#fig:pca_word_cloud_plot">5</a>)A,C).
We also visualized documents projected on selected principal components (Figure {<a href="#fig:pca_word_cloud_plot">5</a>)B).
The first principal component separates bioRxiv preprints that encompass molecular biology results with preprints that contain quantitative biology results (Figure {<a href="#fig:pca_word_cloud_plot">5</a>)C).
This highlights the bisection of biomedical research where majority of results can be categorized under the molecular biology category or the quantitative biology category.
Furthermore, this bisecting trend is evident across individual preprint categories as most categories lie on either side of the first principal component (Figure <a href="#fig:pca1_pointplot">6</a>).
We also provide example preprints from the systems biology category to reinforce this concept (Table <a href="#tbl:five_pc1_table">1</a>).</p>
<p>The second principal component represents the concept of neuroscience vs bioinformatics (Figure {<a href="#fig:pca_word_cloud_plot">5</a>)A).
This principal component suggests that the bulk of preprints within bioRxiv are largely focused around neuroscience and bioinformatic concepts.
This split is evident in Figure <a href="#fig:pca2_pointplot">7</a> as enriched categories along this principal component are quite related to neuroscience (negative end) or bioinformatics (positive end).
As with the first principal component we provide example preprints from the systems biology category to reinforce this concept (Supplemental Table <a href="#tbl:five_pc2_table">2</a>).
More principal component word clouds can be found on our journal recommender website (<a href="https://greenelab.github.io/annorxiver-journal-recommender/">greenelab.github.io/annorxiver-journal-recommender</a>) and within our online repository (see Data Availability).</p>
