    "abstract": "  Low-rank matrix approximations, such as the truncated singular value decomposition and the rank-revealing QR decomposition, play a central role in data analysis and scientific computing. This work surveys and extends recent research which demonstrates that randomization offers a powerful tool for performing low-rank matrix approximation. These techniques exploit modern computational architectures more fully than classical methods and open the possibility of dealing with truly massive data sets.\n  This paper presents a modular framework for constructing randomized algorithms that compute partial matrix decompositions. These methods use random sampling to identify a subspace that captures most of the action of a matrix. The input matrix is then compressed---either explicitly or implicitly---to this subspace, and the reduced matrix is manipulated deterministically to obtain the desired low-rank factorization. In many cases, this approach beats its classical competitors in terms of accuracy, speed, and robustness. These claims are supported by extensive numerical experiments and a detailed error analysis.

The quality of these representations is measured in a word similarity task, and the results are compared to the previously best performing techniques based on different types of neural networks. We observe large improvements in accuracy at much lower computational cost, i.e. it takes less than a day to learn high quality word vectors from a 1.6 billion words data set. Furthermore, we show that these vectors provide state-of-the-art performance on our test set for measuring syntactic and semantic word similarities. ",

PubTator Central (PTC) provides automated annotations from state-of-the-art text mining systems for genes/proteins, genetic variants, diseases, chemicals, species and cell lines, all available for immediate download. PTC annotates PubMed (29 million abstracts) and the PMC Text Mining subset (3 million full text articles). The new PTC web interface allows users to build full text document collections and visualize concept annotations in each document. Annotations are downloadable in multiple formats (XML, JSON and tab delimited) via the online interface, a RESTful web service and bulk FTP. Improved concept identification systems and a new disambiguation module based on deep learning increase annotation accuracy, and the new server-side architecture is significantly faster. PTC is synchronized with PubMed and PubMed Central, with new articles added daily. The original PubTator service has served annotated abstracts for ∼300 million requests, enabling third-party research in use cases such as biocuration support, gene prioritization, genetic disease analysis, and literature-based knowledge discovery. We demonstrate the full text results in PTC significantly increase biomedical concept coverage and anticipate this expansion will both enhance existing downstream applications and enable new use cases.",

    "abstract": "Delays in gene networks result from the sequential nature of protein assembly. However, it is unclear how models of gene networks that use delays should be modified when considering time-dependent changes in temperature. This is important, as delay is often used in models of genetic oscillators that can be entrained by periodic fluctuations in temperature. Here, we analytically derive the time dependence of delay distributions in response to time-varying temperature changes. We find that the resulting time-varying delay is nonlinearly dependent on parameters of the time-varying temperature such as amplitude and frequency, therefore, applying an Arrhenius scaling may result in erroneous conclusions. We use these results to examine a model of a synthetic gene oscillator with temperature compensation. We show that temperature entrainment follows from the same mechanism that results in temperature compensation. Under a common Arrhenius scaling alone, the frequency of the oscillator is sensitive to changes in the mean temperature but robust to changes in the frequency of a periodically time-varying temperature. When a mechanism for temperature compensation is included in the model, however, we show that the oscillator is entrained by periodically varying temperature even when maintaining insensitivity to the mean temperature.",

These tools need to be able to quantify the differences and similarities between computational models. However, depending on the specific application, the notion of “similarity” may greatly vary. A general notion of model similarity, applicable to various types of models, is still missing. Here, we introduce a general notion of quantitative model similarities, survey the use of existing model comparison methods in model building and management, and discuss potential applications of model comparison. To frame model comparison as a general problem, we describe a theoretical approach to defining and computing similarities based on different model aspects. Potentially relevant aspects of a model comprise its references to biological entities, network structure, mathematical equations and parameters, and dynamic behaviour. Future similarity measures could combine these model aspects in flexible, problem-specific ways in order to mimic users’ intuition about model similarity, and to support complex model searches in databases.",

By leveraging single-cell RNA sequencing we inform the design of a mass cytometry panel. To aid in annotation of the mass cytometry datasets, we utilize data integration with a neural network. We introduce approximately 460,000∼ single cell proteomes of non-myocytes as well as 5,000∼ CD31 negative single cell transcriptomes. Using our data, as well as previously reported datasets, we characterize cardiac non-myocytes with high depth in six mice, characterizing novel surface markers (CD9, CD200, Notch3, and FolR2).

    "abstract": "Engagement with scientific manuscripts is frequently facilitated by Twitter and other social media platforms. As such, the demographics of a paper’s social media audience provide a wealth of information about how scholarly research is transmitted, consumed, and interpreted by online communities. By paying attention to public perceptions of their publications, scientists can learn whether their research is stimulating positive scholarly and public thought. They can also become aware of potentially negative patterns of interest from groups that misinterpret their work in harmful ways, either willfully or unintentionally, and devise strategies for altering their messaging to mitigate these impacts. In this study, we collected 331,696 Twitter posts referencing 1,800 highly tweeted bioRxiv preprints and leveraged topic modeling to infer the characteristics of various communities engaging with each preprint on Twitter. We agnostically learned the characteristics of these audience sectors from keywords each user’s followers provide in their Twitter biographies. We estimate that 96% of the preprints analyzed are dominated by academic audiences on Twitter, suggesting that social media attention does not always correspond to greater public exposure. We further demonstrate how our audience segmentation method can quantify the level of interest from non-specialist audience sectors such as mental health advocates, dog lovers, video game developers, vegans, bitcoin investors, conspiracy theorists, journalists, religious groups, and political constituencies. Surprisingly, we also found that 10% of the highly tweeted preprints analyzed have sizable (&gt;5%) audience sectors that are associated with right-wing white nationalist communities. Although none of these preprints intentionally espouse any right-wing extremist messages, cases exist where extremist appropriation comprises more than 50% of the tweets referencing a given preprint. These results present unique opportunities for improving and contextualizing research evaluation as well as shedding light on the unavoidable challenges of scientific discourse afforded by social media.",

    "abstract": "Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) strongly modulate the cholinergic drive to a hierarchy of inhibitory neurons in the superficial layers of the PFC, critical to cognitive processes. Genetic deletion of various types of nAChRs, located on specific interneurons, impacts the properties of ultra-slow transitions between high and low activity states (H-states and L-states, respectively), recorded in mice during quiet wakefulness. In addition, recent data indicate that a genetic mutation of the α5 nAChR subunit located on vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) inhibitory neurons, the rs16969968 single nucleotide polymorphism (α5 SNP), appears to be responsible for “hypofrontality” observed in schizophrenia. Chronic nicotine application to α5 SNP mice restores neural activity to control levels. Using firing rate models of hierarchically organized neural populations, we showed that the change of activity patterns recorded in the genetically modified mice can be explained by a change of activity state stability, differentially modulated by cholinergic inputs to parvalbumin (PV), somatostatin (SOM) or VIP inhibitory populations. A change in amplitude, but not duration of H-states fully account for the lowered pyramidal (PYR) firing rates recorded in α5 SNP mice. We demonstrate that desensitization and upregulation of β2 nAChRs located on SOM interneurons, but not activation of α5 nAChRs located on VIP interneurons, by chronic nicotine application could account for activity normalization recorded in α5 SNP mice. The model implies that subsequent nicotine withdrawal should lead to PYR activity depression more severe than the original hypofrontality caused by SNP mutation.",

What information available for them? And what features do they share that could explain the gap in our understanding? Efforts to build predictive, whole-cell models of inevitably face this knowledge gap. We approached these questions systematically by assembling annotations from the knowledge bases EcoCyc, EcoGene, UniProt, RefSeq, and RegulonDB. We identified the genes that lack direct experimental evidence of function (the “y-ome”) which include 1563 of 4653 unique genes (34%), of which 131 have absolutely no evidence of function. An additional 304 genes (6.6%) are pseudogenes or phantom genes. y-ome genes tend to have lower expression levels and are enriched in the termination region of the chromosome. Where evidence is available for y-ome genes, it most often points to them being membrane proteins and transporters. We resolve the misconception that a gene in whose primary name starts with “y” is unannotated, and we discuss the value of the y-ome for systematic improvement of knowledge bases and its extension to other organisms.",

    "abstract": "Several examples of transcription factors that show stochastic, unsynchronized pulses of nuclear localization have been described. Here we show that under constant calcium stress, nuclear localization pulses of the transcription factor Crz1 follow stochastic variations in cytoplasmic calcium concentration. We find that the size of the stochastic calcium pulses is positively correlated with the number of subsequent Crz1 pulses. Based on our observations, we propose a simple stochastic model of how the signaling pathway converts a constant external calcium concentration into a digital number of Crz1 pulses in the nucleus, due to the time delay from nuclear transport and the stochastic decoherence of individual Crz1 molecule dynamics. We find support for several additional predictions of the model and conclude that stochastic input to nuclear transport may produce digital responses to analog signals in other signaling systems.",

Targeting T cell death pathways dysregulated by HIV infection offers a novel approach for eradication of the latent reservoir. To identify potential therapeutic targets, we compared signaling and apoptosis in uninfected and latently infected primary cultured CD4+ central memory T cells by mass cytometry following T cell receptor stimulation. We found that HIV-infected cells were sensitized to activation of pro-apoptotic p38 kinase signaling via p53, and to inhibition of anti-apoptotic mTOR kinase signaling, even without HIV protein expression. Simultaneous targeting of p38 and mTOR kinases in resting CD4+ T cells from virally-suppressed HIV+ patients reduced cell-associated HIV RNA and DNA. Our results demonstrate how systems biology approaches are useful for identifying novel therapeutic approaches to treat HIV latency, and further suggest that it may be possible to deplete latent HIV-infected T cells without viral reactivation.",

We have named this gene and characterize it through a combination of quantitative live-cell total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy, electron microscopy, RNAi depletion, and genetics. We found that Naus co-localizes with F-actin and Cortactin in the lamellipodia of S2R+ and D25c2 cells and this localization is lost following Cortactin or Arp2/3 depletion or by mutations that disrupt a conserved proline patch found in its mammalian homologs. Using Permeabilization Activated Reduction in Fluorescence (PARF) and Fluorescence Recovery after Photo-bleaching (FRAP), we find that depletion of Cortactin alters Naus dynamics leading to a decrease in its half-life. Furthermore, we discovered that Naus depletion in S2R+ cells led to a decrease in actin retrograde flow and a lamellipodia characterized by long, unbranched filaments. We demonstrate that these alterations to the dynamics and underlying actin architecture also affect D25c2 cell migration and decrease arborization in neurons. We present the novel hypothesis that Naus functions to slow Cortactin’s disassociation from Arp2/3 nucleated branch junctions, thereby increasing both branch nucleation and junction stability.",

    "abstract": "Dendritic spines are small subcompartments that protrude from the dendrites of neurons and are important for signaling activity and synaptic communication. These subcompartments have been characterized to have different shapes. While it is known that these shapes are associated with spine function, the specific nature of these shape-function relationships is not well understood. In this work, we systematically investigated the relationship between the shape and size of both the spine head and spine apparatus, a specialized endoplasmic reticulum compartment in the spine head, in modulating rapid calcium dynamics using mathematical modeling. We developed a spatial multi-compartment reaction-diffusion model of calcium dynamics in three dimensions with various flux sources including N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDAR), voltage sensitive calcium channels (VSCC), and different ion pumps on the plasma membrane. Using this model, we make several important predictions – first, the volume-to-surface area ratio of the spine regulates calcium dynamics, second, membrane fluxes impact calcium dynamics temporally and spatially in a nonlinear fashion, and finally the spine apparatus can act as a physical buffer for calcium by acting as a sink and rescaling the calcium concentration. These predictions set the stage for future experimental investigations of calcium dynamics in dendritic spines.",

    "abstract": "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have proven to be a valuable approach for identifying genetic intervals associated with phenotypic variation in . These intervals can vary in size, depending on the historical local recombination near each significant interval. Typically, significant intervals span numerous gene models, limiting the ability to resolve high-confidence candidate genes underlying the trait of interest. Additional genomic data, including gene co-expression networks, can be combined with the genetic mapping information to successfully identify candidate genes. Co-expression network analysis provides information about the functional relationships of each gene through its similarity of expression patterns to other well-defined clusters of genes. In this study, we integrated data from GWAS and co-expression networks to pinpoint candidate genes that may be associated with nodule-related phenotypes in . We further investigated a subset of these genes and confirmed that several had existing evidence linking them nodulation, including MEDTR2G101090 (PEN3-like), a previously validated gene associated with nodule number.",

    "abstract": "Immune cells need to swiftly and effectively respond to invading pathogens. This response relies heavily on rapid protein synthesis and accurate cellular targeting to ensure pathogen destruction. In return, pathogens intercept this response to ensure their survival and proliferation. To gain insight into this dynamic interface, we combined click-chemistry with pulsed stable isotope labeling of amino acids (pSILAC-AHA) in cell culture to quantify the newly synthesised host proteome during macrophage infection with the model intracellular bacterial pathogen, Typhimurium ( Tm). We monitored newly synthesised proteins across different host cell compartments and infection stages, and used available proteomics data in response to lipopolysaccharide to deconvolute the Tm-specific response. Within this rich resource, we detected aberrant trafficking of lysosomal proteases to the extracellular space and the nucleus, the latter of which correlated with signatures of cell death. Pharmacological cathepsin inhibition suppressed Caspase-11 dependent macrophage cell death, thus demonstrating an active role for cathepsins during Tm induced pyroptosis. Our study illustrates that resolving host proteome dynamics during infection can drive the discovery of biological mechanisms at the host-microbe interface.",

    "abstract": "Linkage mapping is one of the most commonly used methods to identify genetic loci that determine a trait. However, the loci identified by linkage mapping may contain hundreds of candidate genes and require a time-consuming and labor-intensive fine mapping process to find the causal gene controlling the trait. With the availability of a rich assortment of genomic and functional genomic data, it is possible to develop a computational method to facilitate faster identification of causal genes. We developed QTG-Finder, a machine learning based algorithm to prioritize causal genes by ranking genes within a quantitative trait locus (QTL). Two predictive models were trained separately based on known causal genes in Arabidopsis and rice. With an independent validation analysis, we demonstrate the models can correctly prioritize about 65% and 60% of Arabidopsis and rice causal genes when the top 20% ranked genes were considered. The models can prioritize different types of traits though at different efficiency. We also identified several important features of causal genes including paralog copy number, being a transporter, being a transcription factor, and containing SNPs that cause premature stop codon. This work lays the foundation for systematically understanding characteristics of causal genes and establishes a pipeline to predict causal genes based on public data.",

    "abstract": "The consequences of metabolic reprogramming in cancer can include an increased dependence on metabolic substrates such as glucose for survival. As such, the vulnerability of cancer cells to glucose deprivation creates an attractive opportunity for therapeutic intervention. Because it is not possible to starve tumors of glucose , we sought to identify the mechanisms regulating cancer cell death upon glucose deprivation and then design combinations of inhibitors to mimic glucose deprivation-induced cell death. Using metabolomic profiling, we found that cells undergoing glucose deprivation-induced cell death exhibited dramatic accumulation of intracellular L-cysteine and its oxidized dimer, L-cystine, and depletion of the antioxidant glutathione. Building on this observation, we show that glucose deprivation-induced cell death is driven not by lack of glucose but rather by L-cystine import. Following glucose deprivation, the import of L-cystine and subsequent reduction to L-cysteine depleted both NADPH and glutathione, thereby allowing toxic accumulation of reactive oxygen species. Consistent with this model, we found that the glutamate/cystine antiporter, xCT, was required for sensitivity to glucose deprivation. We searched for glycolytic enzymes whose expression is essential for survival of cancer cells with high xCT expression and identified the glucose transporter GLUT1. We therefore tested a drug combination co-targeting GLUT1 and glutathione synthesis and found that these drugs induced synthetic lethal cell death in high xCT-expressing cell lines susceptible to glucose deprivation. These results indicate that co-targeting GLUT1 and glutathione synthesis is a potential therapeutic approach in tumors dependent on glucose for survival.",

    "abstract": "Activation of inflammatory pathways in myeloid cells initiates insulin resistance leading to the development of type-2 diabetes and microvascular disease. Currently, there are no therapies available that target inflammation in T2D or microvascular disease. In the present study we investigate if Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) may represent a novel therapeutic target using the FDA approved medication ibrutinib. Ibrutinib treatment protected high fat diet (HFD)-fed mice from developing insulin resistance and improved glycaemic control by restoring signalling through IRS-1/Akt/GSK-3β pathway. These improvements were independent of body weight and calorific intake. Treatment with ibrutinib to mice fed a HFD reduced NF-κB and reduced inflammatory gene expression, this was coupled with decreased activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in the diabetic liver and kidney. Ibrutinib treatment also protected mice from the development of diabetic nephropathy by reducing monocyte/macrophage infiltration due to reduced expression of the pro-inflammatory chemokines. Ibrutinib treatment to human monocyte derived macrophages significantly reduced pro-inflammatory gene expression and a significant reduction in IL-1β and TNFα after LPS stimulation. In the present study we provide ‘proof of concept’ evidence that BTK is a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of T2D and ibrutinib may be a candidate for drug repurposing in T2D.",

    "abstract": "Oncogenes can generate metabolic vulnerabilities in cancer cells. Here, we tested how AKT and MYC affect the ability of cells to shift between respiration and glycolysis. Using immortalized mammary epithelial cells, we discovered that constitutively active AKT but not MYC induced cell death in galactose culture, where cells must rely on oxidative phosphorylation for energy generation. However, the negative effects of AKT were short-lived, and AKT-expressing cells recommenced growth after ~15 days in galactose. To identify the mechanisms regulating AKT-mediated cell death, we used metabolomics and found that AKT cells dying in galactose upregulated glutathione metabolism. Next, using proteomics, we discovered that AKT-expressing cells dying in galactose upregulated nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, a marker of sensitivity to oxidative stress. We therefore measured levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and discovered that galactose induced ROS in cells expressing AKT but not MYC. Additionally, ROS were required for the galactose-induced death of AKT-expressing cells. We then tested whether these findings could be replicated in breast cancer cell lines with constitutively active AKT signaling. Indeed, we found that galactose induced rapid cell death in breast cancer cell lines and that ROS were required for galactose-induced cell death. Together, our results demonstrate that AKT but not MYC induces a metabolic vulnerability in cancer cells, namely the restricted flexibility to use oxidative phosphorylation.",

These BGCs represented 212 distinct BGC families, of which only 20 have associated products in the MIBiG standard database with functions such as siderophores, antibiotics, and genotoxins. Pangenome analysis identified genes associated with a specific BGC encoding for colon cancer-related colibactin. In one example, we associated genes involved in the type VI secretion system with the presence of a colibactin BGC in .

While the dynamics of the system can be analyzed via computer simulations, substantial computational resources are often required given uncertain parameter values resulting in large numbers of parameter combinations, especially when realistic biological features are included. Simulation alone also often does not yield the kinds of intuitive insights from analytical solutions. Here we introduce a general framework combining stochastic/mechanistic simulation of reaction systems and machine learning of the simulation data to generate computationally efficient predictive models and interpretable parameter-phenotype maps. We applied our approach to investigate stochastic gene expression propagation in biological networks, which is a contemporary challenge in the quantitative modeling of single-cell heterogeneity. We found that accurate, predictive machine-learning models of stochastic simulation results can be constructed. Even in the simplest networks existing analytical schemes generated significantly less accurate predictions than our approach, which revealed interesting insights when applied to more complex circuits, including the extensive tunability of information propagation enabled by feedforward circuits and how even single negative feedbacks can utilize stochastic fluctuations to generate robust oscillations. Our approach is applicable beyond biology and opens up a new avenue for exploring complex dynamical systems.",

    "abstract": "The traditional publication process delays dissemination of new research, often by months, sometimes by years. Preprint servers decouple dissemination of research papers from their evaluation and certification by journals, allowing researchers to share work immediately, receive feedback from a much larger audience, and provide evidence of productivity long before formal publication. Launched in 2013 as a non-profit community service, the bioRxiv server has brought preprint practice to the life sciences and recently posted its 64,000th manuscript. The server now receives more than four million views per month and hosts papers spanning all areas of biology. Initially dominated by evolutionary biology, genetics/genomics and computational biology, bioRxiv has been increasingly populated by papers in neuroscience, cell and developmental biology, and many other fields. Changes in journal and funder policies that encourage preprint posting have helped drive adoption, as has the development of bioRxiv technologies that allow authors to transfer papers easily between the server and journals. A bioRxiv user survey found that 42% of authors post their preprints prior to journal submission whereas 37% post concurrently with journal submission. Authors are motivated by a desire to share work early; they value the feedback they receive, and very rarely experience any negative consequences of preprint posting. Rapid dissemination via bioRxiv is also encouraging new initiatives that experiment with the peer review process and the development of novel approaches to literature filtering and assessment.",

    "abstract": "A computational model is developed to study electrical propagation of vasodilatory signals and arteriolar regulation of blood flow depending on the oxygen tension and agonist distribution in capillary network. The involving key parameters of endothelial cell-to-cell electrical conductivity and plasma membrane area per unit volume were calibrated with the experimental data on an isolated endothelial tube of mouse skeletal feeding arteries. The oxygen saturation parameters in terms of ATP release from erythrocytes are estimated from the data of a left anterior descending coronary blood perfusion of dog. In regard to the acetylcholine induced upstream conduction, our model shows that spatially uniform superfusion of acetylcholine attenuates the electrical signal propagation, and blocking calcium activated potassium channels suppresses that attenuation. On the other hand, local infusion of acetylcholine induces enhanced electrical propagation that corresponds to physiological relevance. In the integration of the endothelial tube and the lumped arterioles vessel model, we show that endothelial purinergic oxygen sensing of ATP released from erythrocytes and local infusion of acetylcholine are all individually effective to induce vasodilatory signals to regulate blood flow in arterioles. We have recapitulated the upstream vasomotion in arterioles from the elevated oxygen tension in the downstream capillary domain. This study is a foundation for characterizing effective pharmaceutical strategies for ascending vasodilation and oxygenation.",

    "abstract": "A potential motivation for scientists to deposit their scientific work as preprints is to enhance its citation or social impact. In this study we assessed the citation and altmetric advantage of bioRxiv, a preprint server for the biological sciences. We retrieved metadata of all bioRxiv preprints deposited between November 2013 and December 2017, and matched them to articles that were subsequently published in peer-reviewed journals. Citation data from Scopus and altmetric data from Altmetric.com were used to compare citation and online sharing behavior of bioRxiv preprints, their related journal articles, and nondeposited articles published in the same journals. We found that bioRxiv-deposited journal articles had sizably higher citation and altmetric counts compared to nondeposited articles. Regression analysis reveals that this advantage is not explained by multiple explanatory variables related to the articles’ publication venues and authorship. Further research will be required to establish whether such an effect is causal in nature. bioRxiv preprints themselves are being directly cited in journal articles, regardless of whether the preprint has subsequently been published in a journal. bioRxiv preprints are also shared widely on Twitter and in blogs, but remain relatively scarce in mainstream media and Wikipedia articles, in comparison to peer-reviewed journal articles.",

    "abstract": "The growth of preprints in the life sciences has been reported widely and is driving policy changes for journals and funders, but little quantitative information has been published about preprint usage. Here, we report how we collected and analyzed data on all 37,648 preprints uploaded to bioRxiv.org, the largest biology-focused preprint server, in its first five years. The rate of preprint uploads to bioRxiv continues to grow (exceeding 2,100 in October 2018), as does the number of downloads (1.1 million in October 2018). We also find that two-thirds of preprints posted before 2017 were later published in peer-reviewed journals, and find a relationship between the number of downloads a preprint has received and the impact factor of the journal in which it is published. We also describe Rxivist.org, a web application that provides multiple ways to interact with preprint metadata.",

    "abstract": "Preprints in biology are becoming more popular, but only a small fraction of the articles published in peer-reviewed journals have previously been released as preprints. To examine whether releasing a preprint on bioRxiv was associated with the attention and citations received by the corresponding peer-reviewed article, we assembled a dataset of 74,239 articles, 5,405 of which had a preprint, published in 39 journals. Using log-linear regression and random-effects meta-analysis, we found that articles with a preprint had, on average, a 49% higher Altmetric Attention Score and 36% more citations than articles without a preprint. These associations were independent of several other article- and author-level variables (such as scientific subfield and number of authors), and were unrelated to journal-level variables such as access model and Impact Factor. This observational study can help researchers and publishers make informed decisions about how to incorporate preprints into their work.",
