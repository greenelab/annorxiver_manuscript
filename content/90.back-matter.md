Topic associated tokens are highly enriched when comparing bioRxiv to the New York Times.
The plot on the left (A) is a point range plot of the odds ratio with respect to bioRxiv.
Values greater than one indicate a high association with bioRxiv whereas values less than one indicate high association with the New York Times.
The dotted line provides a breaking point between both categories.
The plot on the right (B) is a bar chart of token frequency appearing in bioRxiv and New York Times respectively.

Typesetting symbols and biologically relevant tokens are highly enriched when comparing PubMed Central (PMC) to the New York Times.
The plot on the left (A) is a point range plot of the odds ratio with respect to PMC.
Values greater than one indicate a high association with PMC whereas values less than one indicate high association with the New York Times.
The dotted line provides a breaking point between both categories.
The plot on the right (B) is a bar chart of token frequency appearing in PMC and New York Times respectively.

Both classifiers outperform the randomized baseline when predicting a paper's journal endpoint.
This bargraph shows each model's accuracy in respect to predicting the training and test set.

**A.** The Preprints in Motion were published faster than other bioRxiv preprints, and the number of versions was not associated with an increase in time to publication.
The x-axis shows the number of versions of a preprint posted on bioRxiv.
The y-axis indicates the number of days that elapsed between the first version of a preprint posted on bioRxiv and the date at which the peer-reviewed publication appeared.
The density of observations is depicted in the violin plot with an embedded boxplot.
The red dots and red regression line represent Preprints in Motion.
**B.** The Preprints in Motion collection were published faster than other bioRxiv preprints, and no dependence between the amount of linguistic change and time to publish was observed.
The x-axis shows the Euclidean distance between document representations of the first version of a preprint and its peer-reviewed form.
The y-axis shows the number of days elapsed between the first version of a preprint posted on bioRxiv and when a preprint is published.
The color bar on the right represents the density of each hexbin in this plot, where more dense regions are shown in a brighter color.
The red dots and red regression line represent Preprints in Motion.
