### Document embeddings derived from bioRxiv reveal fields and subfields

![
**A.** Principal components (PC) analysis of bioRxiv word2vec embeddings groups documents based on author-selected categories.
We visualized documents from key categories on a scatterplot for the first two PCs.
The first PC separated cell biology from informatics-related fields, and the second PC separated bioinformatics from neuroscience fields.
**B.** A word cloud visualization of PC1.
Each word cloud depicts the cosine similarity score between tokens and the first PC.
Tokens in orange were most similar to the PC's positive direction, while tokens in blue were most similar to the PC's negative direction.
The size of each token indicates the magnitude of the similarity.
**C.** A word cloud visualization of PC2, which separated bioinformatics from neuroscience.
Similar to the first PC, tokens in orange were most similar to the PC's positive direction, while tokens in blue were most similar to the PC's negative direction.
The size of each token indicates the magnitude of the similarity.
**D.** Examining PC1 values for each article by category created a continuum from informatics-related fields on the top through cell biology on the bottom.
Specific article categories (neuroscience, genetics) were spread throughout PC1 values.
**E.** Examining PC2 values for each article by category revealed fields like genomics, bioinformatics, and genetics on the top and neuroscience and behavior on the bottom.

Document embeddings provide a means to categorize the language of documents in a way that takes into account the similarities between terms [@arxiv:1405.4053; @arxiv:1707.02377; @arxiv:2001.05727].
We found that the first two PCs separated articles from different author-selected categories (Figure {@fig:topic_analysis_panels}A).
Certain neuroscience papers appeared to be more associated with the cellular biology direction of PC1, while others seemed to be more associated with the informatics-related direction Figure {@fig:topic_analysis_panels}A).
This suggests that the concepts captured by PCs were not exclusively related to their field.

Visualizing token-PC similarity revealed tokens associated with certain research approaches (Figures {@fig:topic_analysis_panels}B and {@fig:topic_analysis_panels}C).
Token association of PC1 shows the separation of cell biology and informatics-related fields through tokens: "empirical", "estimates" and "statistics" depicted in orange and "cultured" and "overexpressing" shown in blue (Figure {@fig:topic_analysis_panels}B).
Association for PC2 shows the separation of bioinformatics and neuroscience via tokens: "genomic", "genome" and "genomes" depicted in orange and "evoked", "stimulus" and "stimulation" shown in blue (Figure {@fig:topic_analysis_panels}C).

Examining the value for PC1 across all author-selected categories revealed an ordering of fields from cell biology to informatics-related disciplines (Figure {@fig:topic_analysis_panels}D).
These results suggest that a primary driver of the variability within the language used in bioRxiv could be the divide between informatics and cell biology approaches.
A similar analysis for PC2 suggested that neuroscience and bioinformatics present a similar language continuum (Figure {@fig:topic_analysis_panels}E).
This result supports the notion that bioRxiv contains an influx of neuroscience and bioinformatics-related research results. 
For both of the top two PCs, the submitter-selected category of systems biology preprints was near the middle of the distribution and had a relatively large interquartile range when compared with other categories (Figure {@fig:topic_analysis_panels}D and {@fig:topic_analysis_panels}E), suggesting that systems biology is a broader subfield containing both informatics and cellular biology approaches. 

Examining the top five and bottom five preprints within the systems biology field reinforces PC1's dichotomous theme (Table {@tbl:five_pc1_table}).
Preprints with the highest values [@doi:10.1101/197400;@doi:10.1101/825943;@doi:10.1101/044818;@doi:10.1101/769299;@doi:10.1101/107250] included software packages, machine learning analyses, and other computational biology manuscripts, while preprints with the lowest values [@doi:10.1101/455048;@doi:10.1101/371922;@doi:10.1101/733162;@doi:10.1101/745943;@doi:10.1101/754572] were focused on cellular signaling and protein activity.
We provide the rest of our 50 generated PCs in our online repository (see Software and Data Availability).
