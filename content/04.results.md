### Comparing bioRxiv to PubMed Central

#### bioRxiv Repository

![
Neuroscience and bioinformatics are the two most common topics for preprints on bioRxiv.
This bar chart depicts the number of preprints that fall into each author-selected topic area.

![
Most of bioRxiv's preprints report new research findings.
This bar chart depicts the number of articles categorized based on author-selected article types.

Each preprint on bioRxiv has an author-selected topic area, and the predominant area in past reports has been neuroscience [@doi:10.7554/eLife.45133].
Our analysis of the full text release of bioRxiv confirms this previous finding (Figure {@fig:biorxiv_categories}).
The author-selected topic area abundances that we found in the full text largely matched previous studies [@doi:10.7554/eLife.45133; @doi:10.1001/jama.2017.21168].
One exception was microbiology, which has a larger share of preprints than in a previous report from 2018 [@doi:10.7554/eLife.45133] (Figure {@fig:biorxiv_categories}).
Authors also select from three article types when they upload their preprints.
We found that most preprints are categorized as new results (Figure {@fig:biorxiv_headings}), which is consistent with previous findings [@doi:10.1001/jama.2017.21168].

#### Global Comparison of bioRxiv and PubMed Central 

![
BioRxiv is more focused on biological discoveries rather than disease treatments and clinical trials.
The plot on the left (A) is a point range plot of the odds ratio with respect to bioRxiv.
Values greater than one indicate a high association with bioRxiv whereas values less than one indicate high association with PubMed Central.
The dotted line provides a breaking point between both categories.
The plot on the right (B) is a bar chart of token frequency appearing in bioRxiv and PMC respectively.

The linguistic style of the bioRxiv corpus differs from the PMC corpus.
We compared preprints in bioRxiv with published manuscripts in PMC.
We found that tokens such as "neuron", "genome", "RNA" and "network" had a high odds ratio, indicating enrichment in bioRxiv (Figure {@fig:biorxiv_pmc_global_comparison}).
Likewise, we found tokens such as "patient", "health", $\pm$, and "ml" to have a low odds ratio, indicating enrichment in PMC (Figure {@fig:biorxiv_pmc_global_comparison}).
This separation of tokens suggests a prevalence of articles focused on clinical trials and patient research within PMC compared to bioRxiv.
Furthermore, bioRxiv has a predominance of neuroscience and bioinformatic topics.
In regard to writing, citation styles diversify from the familiar "et al." form as preprints transition through the publication process.
Additionally, published articles have an increase of typesetting ($\pm$) and measurement symbols ("ml", "age") compared to preprints. 

#### Published Preprint Differences

![
Top scoring tokens for preprints are focused on figure citations whereas their published versions are more focused on data availability.
The plot on the left (A) is a point range plot of the odds ratio with respect to preprints.
Values greater than one indicate a high association with preprints while values less than one indicate a high association with published articles.
The dotted line provides a breaking point between both categories.
The plot on the right (B) is a barchart of token frequency appearing in preprints and published versions of preprints respectively.
](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danich1/annorxiver/f5d6c2d04e2fef0d38eaee77ef6c2a0b19ef6358/biorxiv/corpora_comparison/output/figures/preprint_published_comparison.png){#fig:biorxiv_pmc_pre_published_comp}

A preprint's linguistic style can change once a preprint has undergone the revision process prior to being published.
We quantified this linguistic difference by calculating the odds ratio of tokens appearing in the union in bioRxiv preprints and their published counterparts within PMC.
Tokens with an odds ratio greater than one are mainly centered on paper/figure references and research specific terms (Figure {@fig:biorxiv_pmc_pre_published_comp}).
Tokens with an odds ratio of less than one are focused on data availability, and research measurements such as number of cases and controls or significance testing (Figure {@fig:biorxiv_pmc_pre_published_comp}).

### Topic Analysis of bioRxiv's Principal Components

![
The top two principal components (PCs) appear to capture molecular vs quantitative biology (PC1) and genomics vs bioinformatics (PC2).
The left most plot (A) is a word cloud for the second PC.
Tokens in orange are associated with a PC's positive axis while tokens in blue are associated with the PC's negative axis.
The size of each token indicates the strength of association.
The word cloud at the bottom right (C) is for the first PC and follows the same trend as previously described.
The scatter plot at the top right (B) is a visualization of documents being plotted along the PC's axes.
Documents were hand-picked based on the concepts captured by each PC.

We explored the document representations to understand the primary differences between the full text of bioRxiv preprints by performing principal components analysis of the document embeddings.
We visualized documents on principal components for selected components (Figure {@fig:pca_word_cloud_plot)B) and the loadings for each component (Figure {@fig:pca_word_cloud_plot)A,C).
The first principal component bioRxiv preprint document embeddings separated words frequent in molecular biology from those frequent in quantitative biology.
This highlights the bisection of biomedical research where majority of results came from molecular biology experiments or quantitative biology experiments.
The second most predominant source of variation is the concept of neuroscience vs bioinformatics (Figure {@fig:pca_word_cloud_plot) A).
This suggests that the bulk of preprints are centered around neuroscience and bioinformatic research fields.
More word clouds can be found within our online repository (see Data Availability).
