## Discussion and Conclusions

BioRxiv is a constantly growing repository that contains life science preprints.
The majority of research involving bioRxiv focuses on the metadata of preprints; however, the language contained within these preprints has not previously been systematically examined.
Throughout this work, we sought to analyze the language contained within these preprints and understand how it changes in response to peer review.
Through our global corpora analysis, we found that writing within bioRxiv is consistent with the biomedical literature contained in the PMCOA repository, suggesting that bioRxiv is linguistically similar to PMCOA.
Token-level analyses between bioRxiv and PMCOA suggested that major differences are driven by research fields; e.g., more patient-related research is prevalent in PMCOA than bioRxiv
This observation is expected as preprints focused on medicine are supported by the complementary medRxiv repository [@url:https://www.medrxiv.org/].
Token-level analyses for preprints and their corresponding published version suggest that peer review may focus on data availability and incorporating extra sections for published papers; however, future analyses are needed to ascertain individual token level changes as preprints venture through the publication process.

Document embeddings are a versatile way to examine language contained within preprints, understanding peer review's effect on preprints, and provide extra functionality for preprint repositories.
Examining linguistic variance contained within document embeddings of life science preprints revealed that the largest source of variability was informatics vs cellular biology.
This observation bisects the majority of life science research categories that have integrated preprints within their publication workflow.
Preprints are typically linked with their published articles via bioRxiv manually establishing a link or authors self-reporting that their preprint has been published; however, gaps can occur as preprints change their appearance through multiple versions or authors do not notify bioRxiv. 
Our work suggests that document embeddings can help fill in missing links within bioRxiv.
Furthermore, our analysis reveals that the publication rate for preprints is higher than previously estimated, even though our analysis can only account for papers that are published open access.
Our results raise the lower bound of the total preprint publication fraction; however, the true fraction is necessarily higher.
Future work, especially that which aims to assess the fraction of preprints that are eventually published, should account for the possibility of missed annotations.

Preprints take a variable amount of time to become published, and we examined factors that influence a preprint’s time to publication.
Our half-life analysis on preprint categories revealed that preprints in most bioRxiv categories take similar amounts of time to be published.
A clear exception is the scientific communication and education category, which contained preprints that took much longer to publish.
In respect to individual preprints, each new version adds several weeks to a preprints time to publication, which is roughly aligned with authors making changes after a round of peer review; furthermore, preprints that undergo substantial changes take longer to publish.
Overall these results illustrate that bioRxiv is a practical resource for obtaining insight into the peer-review process.

Lastly, we found that document embeddings were associated with the eventual journal at which the work was published.
We trained two machine learning models to identify which journals publish linguistically similar papers towards a query preprint.
Our models achieved a considerably higher fold change over the baseline model, so we constructed a web application that makes our models available to the public and returns a list of the papers and journals that are linguistically similar to a bioRxiv or medRxiv preprint.
