## Introduction

The dissemination of research findings is key to science.
Initially much of this communication happened orally [@doi:10.1021/ci00050a001].
During the 17th century, the predominate form of communication shifted to personal letters that were shared from one scientist to another [@doi:10.1021/ci00050a001].
Scientific journals didn't become a predominant mode of communication until the 19th and 20th centuries when the first journal was created [@doi:10.1021/ci00050a001; @smith2006trouble; @doi:10.1300/J123v41n01_04].
Although scientific journals became the primary method of communication, they added high maintenance costs and long publication times to scientific discourse [@smith2006trouble; @doi:10.1300/J123v41n01_04].
Some scientists’ solution to these issues has been to also communicate through preprints, which are scholarly works that have yet to undergo peer review process [@doi:10.1177/0192623318767322; @doi:10.1371/journal.pbio.2003995].

Preprints are commonly hosted on online repositories, where users have open and easy access to these works.
Notable repositories include arXiv [@doi:10.1108/14666180010345564], bioRxiv [@doi:10.1101/833400] and medRxiv [@url:https://www.medrxiv.org/]; however, there are over 60 different repositories available [@url:https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2019/10/16/the-second-wave-of-preprint-servers-how-can-publishers-keep-afloat/].
The burgeoning uptake of preprints in life sciences has been examined through research focused on metadata from the bioRxiv repository.
For example, life science preprints are being posted at an increasing rate  [@doi:10.1371/journal.pbio.3000269].
Furthermore, these preprints are being rapidly shared on social media, routinely downloaded, and cited [@doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0047523].
Certain preprint categories are read and shared by both scientists and non-scientists alike [@doi:10.1101/2020.03.06.981589].
About two-thirds to three-quarters of preprints are eventually published [@doi:10.7554/eLife.45133.001; @doi:10.1002/pra2.175] and life science articles that have a corresponding preprint version are cited and discussed more often than articles without them [@doi:10.1162/qss_a_00043; @doi:10.7554/eLife.52646; @doi:10.12688/f1000research.19619.2].
Preprints take an average of 160 days to be published in the peer reviewed literature [@doi:10.2139/ssrn.3455146], and those with multiple versions take longer to publish[@doi:10.2139/ssrn.3455146].

The rapid uptake of preprints in the life sciences also poses challenges. 
Preprint repositories receive a growing number of submissions [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1008565].
Linking preprints with their published counterparts is a key part in maintaining consistency of scholarly discourse but is challenging to perform manually [@doi:10.1038/530265a; @doi:10.7554/eLife.52646].
Errors and omissions in linkage result in missing links and consequently erroneous metadata.
Furthermore, repositories based on standard publishing tools are not designed to show how textual content of preprints are altered due to the peer review process [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1008565].
Certain scientists have expressed concern that they could be scooped by competitors by making results available before publication [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1008565; @doi:10.1371/journal.pbio.3000151].
Preprint repositories by definition do not perform in-depth peer review, which can result in posted preprints containing inconsistent results or conclusions [@doi:10.12688/f1000research.19619.2; @doi:10.1007/s10393-018-1352-3; @doi:10.1038/530265a; @doi:10.1016/j.bpj.2016.06.035]; however, scientists have found that preprints posted at the beginning of 2020 underwent minor changes as prepeints became published [@doi:10.1101/2021.02.20.432090v1].
Despite a growing emphasis on using the study of preprints to examine the publishing process in the life sciences, how these findings relate to the text of documents within bioRxiv prior to the year 2020 has yet to be examined.

Textual analysis uses linguistic, statistical and machine learning techniques to analyze and extract information from text [@doi:10.1111/1475-679X.12123]. 
For instance, scientists analyzed linguistic similarities and differences of biomedical corpora [@doi:10.1186/1471-2105-10-183;10.1186/1471-2105-9-S3-S6; @pmc:PMC442180].
Scientists have provided the community with a number of tools that aide future text mining systems [@doi:10.1093/bib/bbs084; @doi:10.1093/nar/gkz389; @doi:10.1186/s12859-017-1775-9] as well as advice on how to train and test future text processing systems [@doi:10.1186/1471-2105-11-492; @doi:10.1186/1471-2105-13-207; @doi:10.1186/s12859-019-2604-0].
Here, we use textual analysis to examine the bioRxiv repository, placing a particular emphasis on understanding the extent to which full text analysis can address hypotheses derived from the analysis of metadata alone.

To understand how preprints relate to the traditional publishing ecosystem, we examine the linguistic similarities and differences between preprints and peer reviewed text and observe how linguistic features change during the peer review and publishing process.
We hypothesize that preprints and biomedical text are quite similar, especially when controlling for the differential uptake of preprints across fields.
Furthermore, we hypothesize that document embeddings [@arxiv:1301.3781; @arxiv:1405.4053] provide a versatile way to disentangle linguistic features along with serving as a practical medium for improving preprint repository functionality.
We test this hypothesis by producing a linguistic landscape of bioRxiv preprints, detecting preprints that change substantially during publication, and identify journals that publish manuscripts that are linguistically similar to a target preprint.
We encapsulate our findings through a web-app that projects a user-selected preprint onto this landscape and suggests journals and articles that are linguistically similar.
Taken together, our work reveals how linguistically similar and dissimilar preprints are to peer reviewed text, quantifies linguistic changes that occur during the peer review process and highlights the feasibility of document embeddings in respect to preprint repository functionality and peer review's affect on publication time.
