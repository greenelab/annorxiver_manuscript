## Discussion

We analyzed the language contained used in preprints and examined how it changes through the publication process.  
We found that bioRxiv and PubMed Central (PMC) have similar word frequency distributions, which suggests that the overall manner of writing is consistent with the biomedical literature. 
At the token level, those most strongly associated with bioRxiv are related to neuroscience and bioinformatics, which are also fields that have seen high uptake of preprinting [@doi:10.7554/eLife.45133].
We noticed that a multitude of preprints highly associated with the first principal component have restrictive or no copyright license (Table {#tbl:five_pc1_table}).
This finding highlights the ongoing problem of restricted access within the scientific community [@doi:10.1038/nature.2017.22161; @url:https://blog.dhimmel.com/biorxiv-licenses/].
We also found that the second principal component for our language embedding differentiated neuroscience and bioinformatics papers.

We examined preprints that were textually similar to published articles and found numerous preprints that had been published and not previously linked, which led us to find that the life sciences preprint publication rate is higher than previously estimated.
Preprint-publication similarity also predicts the journals that will publish a manuscript.
This observation enabled us to provide a web application that allows users to identify the papers and journals that are most similar to a _bioRxiv_ or _medRxiv_ preprint.
